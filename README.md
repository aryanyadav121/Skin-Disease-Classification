# Skin-Disease-Classification
Our major project focuses on skin diseases classification using CNN, VGG-16, and ResNet. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) along with deep learning architectures like VGG-16 and ResNet, we aim to accurately categorize various skin diseases for efficient diagnosis and treatment.
